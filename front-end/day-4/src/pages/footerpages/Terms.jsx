             <h2>4. Working of Auction</h2>
             <p>
             When a bid is placed, number of credits are deducted from the user’s bidding account as per the specified number of credits for that auction. 
             Placed bids are not refundable. An auction closes when no more bids are received by BidBunny’s servers. The countdown time is indicated for each
             auction. Due to the time it takes for bids to reach BidBunny’s servers, and in order to allow all users the same opportunity to bid regardless of
            geographic location, BidBunny’s servers will wait for an additional 5 seconds for any placed bids to reach BidBunny servers before closing the auction.
            The user who was the last to place a bid wins the auction and can purchase the product.
            Bids become valid when they are entered in the BidBunny database and registered in BidBunny’s system. BidBunny is not responsible for disruptions in the 
            user’s connection and errors that may occur as a result of this. This includes, but is not limited to, incorrect countdown of the remaining time, outdated information on bidders, and bids.
             </p>
       
             <h2>5. Payment</h2>
             <p>
             Once an auction is closed, the winner, goes to My Account for information on the total price, including shipping costs, and payment options. 
             Once the auction is closed, the winner has 15 days to pay the total price of the product, by following the steps indicated on the website. After 
             confirming the win and paying the amount due, the winner will receive a confirmation e-mail. BidBunny will ship the product within 21 days after 
             payment confirmation is received. The buyer must also provide an accurate delivery address on the account, before BidBunny can ship the product. 
             After BidBunny has shipped the product, it will take a few days for it to reach the buyer.
             If an auction win has not been confirmed and paid within 15 days, the order will be void and cancelled, spent bids will not be refunded.
             </p>
       
             <h2>6. Delivery</h2>
             <p>
             As BidBunny works with trusted delivery partners to ensure the best possible service and widest reach, all delivery estimates are for information
              only and do not constitute binding agreements. Obvious damage to the item or packaging during transit should be reported to the carrier by the 
              winning user, if the item is damaged it should be refused, not signed for. If you wish to claim for concealed defects or damage after signing for
               an item, you must inform us about the damaged or faulty goods within 3 days of receipt. BidBunny cannot accept responsibility for damaged or 
               faulty goods once 3 days have lapsed. In all cases you must inspect your item either at the point of or immediately after delivery. Failure to 
               raise a query with BidBunny, concerning a damaged or incorrect item within 3 days of delivery constitutes acceptance of the item as is.
                BidBunny does not accept liability for damage or failure of products due to neglect or misuse by the recipient. In the event that BidBunny’s 
                delivery partners are not able to deliver the item within a reasonable time.
             </p>

             <h2>7. Returns-Refunds</h2>
             <p>
             The product will be delivered to the address specified by the user. All technical service and product support matters must be taken up directly 
             with the manufacturer according to their terms. In case of cancellation of an order, only the purchase price will be refunded. So, shipping costs 
             and spent bids will never be refunded. This policy applies both to auctions and Buy Now option. If you decide to return a product/item, 
             BidBunny will not refund the value of the placed bids of a purchased product/item.
